# ðŸš€ Getting started with DocPro Backend

DocPro's backend is built using [Strapi](https://strapi.io), a powerful and flexible headless CMS. This guide will help you set up, develop, and deploy the backend efficiently.

## Development Scripts

Strapi provides a feature-rich [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli) (CLI) for managing your project.

### `develop`

Start your Strapi application with autoReload enabled for local development.

```bash
npm run develop
# or
yarn develop
```

### `start`

Run your Strapi application with autoReload disabled for production.

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

### `build`

Build the admin panel for production.

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## Deployment

DocPro Backend can be deployed on various platforms. For our setup, the backend is hosted on [Render](https://render.com), but Strapi also supports deployments on platforms like AWS, Heroku, and DigitalOcean.

**Client Live Link:** [DocPro Frontend](https://docpro-app.vercel.app/)

**Server Live Link:** [DocPro Backend](https://docpro-app-backend.onrender.com/)

**Client Github Link:** [Frontend Github](https://github.com/KawsarCoder/DocPro-App)

**Server Github Link:** [Backend Backend](https://github.com/KawsarCoder/DocPro-APP-Backend)

### Build and Deploy

For Render or similar services, ensure that:

1. Environment variables are correctly set, including:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL or other database connection string)
   - `CLOUDINARY_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` (for image storage)
2. The Strapi build command is executed during deployment:

```bash
yarn build
```

For detailed deployment instructions, refer to the [deployment section of the Strapi documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/deployment).
